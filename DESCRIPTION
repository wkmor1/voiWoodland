Description: Value of information (VOI) analyses reveal the expected benefit of reducing uncertainty to a
decision maker. Most ecological VOI analyses have focused on population models rarely addressing more
complex community models. We performed a VOI analysis for a complex state–transition model of
Box-Ironbark Forest and Woodland management. With three management alternatives (limited harvest/
firewood removal (HF), ecological thinning (ET), and no management), managing the system optimally
(for 150 yr) with the original information would, on average, increase the amount of forest in a desirable
state from 19% to 35% (a 16-percentage point increase). Resolving all uncertainty would, on average,
increase the final percentage to 42% (a 19-percentage point increase). However, only resolving the uncertainty
for a single parameter was worth almost two-thirds the value of resolving all uncertainty. We found
the VOI to depend on the number of management options, increasing as the management flexibility
increased. Our analyses show it is more cost-effective to monitor low-density regrowth forest than other
states and more cost-effective to experiment with the no-management alternative than the other manage-
ment alternatives. Importantly, the most cost-effective strategies did not include either the most desired
forest states or the least understood management strategy, ET. This implies that managers cannot just rely
on intuition to tell them where the most VOI will lie, as critical uncertainties in a complex system are
sometimes cryptic.
