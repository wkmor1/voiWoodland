Discussion
==========

The most important implication of these analyses for managers is that
the most cost-effective strategies did not include either the most
desired forest state (mature low-density woodlands), nor what would be
thought of as the least understood management strategy (ecological
thinning). As such, managers cannot just rely on intuition to tell them
where the most value of information is. Critical uncertainties (those
uncertainties that affect decision making) in a complex system might be
not be the most variable, or the uncertainties to which outcomes are
most sensitive. The relationship between value of information and level
of management constraint is also important.

We have identified those aspects of the BIFAW system model that have the
greatest value for learning. If monitoring was targeted at the most
valuable parameters according to the EVPXI analysis, rather than a
random parameter or even the most uncertain parameter, then the expected
performance of a subsequent decision would be greater by up to 7500
hectares of mature low-density woodland (difference between most and
least valuable parameters) given the number of management options and
constraint we used here, which is an average of 50 hectares per year.

We have also shown that if learning is targeted at subsets of the
system, so as to update multiple parameters simultaneously, then some
system states and management options would be better foci than others.
This is because the uncertainty of some parameter sets is more critical
to management decisions than others. Managers would be wiser to focus
monitoring on areas subject to management under the harvest management
scenario rather than the thinning or no management options, because
learning by reducing the uncertainty in the parameters associated with
those latter options would not change the decision about which
management option to use as much on average if their uncertainty was
reduced. Also, if managers chose only to monitor one system state, then
learning about transitions from the low-density regrowth state would see
greater expected benefit than the other three states.

However, where the highest value of information lies depends on the
number and range of management options. In other words, the options
available to managers drive the value of information, as does the
uncertainty they have in the outcome of their potential decisions. The
greater the number and range of management options, the greater the
value of information, because the more options you have the more
potential there is for learning which option is the best. Taken to an
extreme, if you have only one option (i.e., no decision) then learning
would be pointless and the value of information would be zero. In the
present case, when more thinning was permitted, the greatest increase in
EVPXI was for the parameter predicting a transition after thinning took
place (Fig \[fig:evi\_cc\_plot\]). Parameters not associated with
thinning either increased in their EVSI at slower rates or didnâ€™t change
at all.

We found variability in the EVPXI for parameters of the BIFAW system.
Those with the greatest expected value of information were often those
with uncertainty to which the system was most sensitive, but not always.
Similarly, @Moore2012 found that the main drivers of willow invasion
were not necessarily the same as those that there was most value in
learning about. In their case, while fire frequency was a driver of
invasion, it was willow tree seed dispersal that had the greatest value
of information. These results highlight that for optimal decision making
it is not enough to simply identify those aspects of the system to which
objectives are most sensitive. In the context of decision making, the
expected value of information is a better measure of sensitivity than a
simple sensitivity analysis because it can distinguish between
decision-critical uncertainty and mere uncertainty [@Felli1998].

A key advance we have made in this work is to formulate a process for
calculating VOI for complex models with continuous expressions of
uncertainty. For such models the state space is too large to make
integration feasiable for the VOI analyses and Monte Carlo methods must
be used instead. However, Monte Carlo sampling is computationally
expensive and it can be prohibitively time-consuming to refit a complex
model repeatedly (which is necessary for a Monte Carlo simulation). To
overcome this, we represented the state and transition model with an
efficient machine-learning method (MARS) and use the output from this in
our Monte Carlo approxmation of the VOI analysis. The method we present
here, employing Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning, can be used
a template for VOI analyses of complex models with continuous
expressions of uncertainty and extended to other forms VOI including the
expected value of sample information.

In the analyses we have presented here, we have not accounted for
correlations among the transition probabilities. Experts that gave a
particular value for one parameter were often more likely to have given
a particular value for another parameter. We were unable to account for
within-expert correlations among parameters when we updated them in the
posterior analyses. The issue of within-expert correlation is not well
studied. Though others have assessed the related case of between-expert
correlation in parameter estimation [e.g., @Zio1997].

It may be justified to ignore the expert driven correlation among
parameters. An expert could be knowledgeable about one part of the
system and relatively ignorant of another part, with other experts
having reverse properties. Therefore, hybrid models that combine the
uncertainty of multiple experts are just as plausible, or more so, than
the opinion of any one expert. On the other hand one might have faith in
within-expert parameter correlations in general, because if an expert is
right or wrong about one component of a system they could be similarly
right or wrong about other aspects.

The preposterior analyses we performed required us to make assumptions
regarding the monitoring to update the parameters in the model. For
monitoring to take place in the manner described, vegetation states must
be able to easily be determined in the field. In addition they must be
identifiable to a degree of accuracy that they can be distinguished from
one another so that a transition between states is evident and
recordable after revisits occurring in a short space of time. States
must not only themselves be identifiable, but the surveyor must also be
able to tell that a unit of vegetation has been in a state for the
required period of time for a specific transition to occur, and that any
transition that does occur has occurred due to a specific causal agent.
For some transition probabilities this set of assumptions seems
plausible. For instance, the transition from low to high-density
regrowth due to coppicing may not be that hard to identify and record,
whereas recognizing that a unit of vegetation remained as low-density
regrowth because of combination of drought and mistletoe may be far more
difficult. This problem arises because state-transition models are only
supposed to represent vegetation dynamics on average and do necessarily
reflect observable phenomenon.

In summary we would recommend a value of information analyses be
performed to inform monitoring and even decide whether it should take
place at all. We have shown that it can be used to identify which parts
of a complex model system are most valuable to address. Here, given the
assumptions we have outlined above, managers should focus scarce
monitoring resources first on the harvest management option (if that
option is on the table) and the low-density regrowth states. Here we
have demonstrated how Monte Carlo simulation methods can be used to
overcome the challenges of implementing a VOI analyses for a complex,
continuous model. We caution, that the findings are dependent on the
objective and the number of management options available. We have
highlighted this dependence by demonstrating how the value of
information changes differentially among model parameters, as the
constraints on the decision are modified. Managers should be careful to
not jump to conclusions about which uncertainties are critical to a
decision, as in a complex system, those uncertainties may be cryptic.
