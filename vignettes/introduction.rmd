Introduction
============

Ecosystems are typically managed under uncertainty. Monitoring can
reduce uncertainty and facilitate management decisions with greater
expected benefits. On the other hand, sometimes it is unclear whether
monitoring is necessary [@Mcdonaldmadden2010]. The decision to
experiment or monitor at all is only rational if the expected benefit
when making a decision with new information outweighs the cost of
learning. Determining the value of information facilitates calculating
this benefit [@Raiffa1968].

Value of information (VOI) theory is a set of decision theoretic tools
that have previously been applied to decision problems in economics,
medicine, engineering and other domains
[@Dakins1999; @Yokota2004; @Claxton2008; @Wu2013]. With the VOI toolset,
a decision analyst can assess what to monitor, how much to monitor and
even whether monitoring is justified at all. Compared with other fields
such as operations research and medicine, ecology and natural resource
management have been slower to adopt VOI analyses for decision making,
although recently, some examples have appeared in the literature [e.g.,
@Polasky2001; @Moore2011; @Runge2011; @Runting2013]. Most examples have
focused on the application of VOI to models with discrete expressions of
uncertainty [e.g., @Moore2012]. Furthermore, ecological decision problem
solving has tended to focus on models of population dynamics
[@Runge2011; @Canessa2015; @Johnson2014; @Maxwell2015] and has been less
inclined to tackle more complex ecosystem level models.

One reason communities and ecosystems have rarely been the focus of VOI
analysess is that community or ecosystem models do not lend themselves
easily to VOI analysis. Ecosystem models, such as state and transition
models, are often complex. Often models of communities are continuous
rather than discrete [i.e., uncertainty lies in the choices between
discrete models as in @Runge2011] making more difficult to calculate the
VOI. In such cases where there are many parameters with continuous
uncertaint, it is infeasible to perform the analytical calculus required
for the VOI analysis and instead VOI must be estimated using Monte Carlo
simulation [e.g., @Yokota2004]. The challenge of calculating VOI in
these cases lies in being able to express the system model in such a way
that Monte Carlo methods (repeated resampling) can be applied. Here we
demonstrate how Monte Carlo simulation can be used in combination with a
machine learning technique to calculate VOI for a complex continuous
system model so as to better manage an ecological community.

Value of information
--------------------

A value of information analysis can assess the benefit of reducing
epistemic uncertainty before making a decision. An information valuer will
<!--->  Introduce concept of expectation <-->
The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantifies the expected
performance gain if all uncertainty is resolved prior to taking action
[@Raiffa1968]. The EVPI is the upper bound of expected performance
improvement and can identify the amount of resources worth investing to
resolve uncertainty [@Runge2011]. While EVPI provides a value for
complete reduction of uncertainty, the partial value of perfect
information, EVPXI, can quantify the performance gain if uncertainty is
only partially resolved [@Ades2004]. EVPXI is the value of knowing the
exact value of one more (but not all) parameters in a model. Here we
refer to these and other related methods collectively, as the expected
value of information (EVI).

We briefly outline the general form of an EVI analysis. For a more
detailed description of the derivation of EVI and its variants, see the
seminal text of @Raiffa1968 and for more recent treatments see
@Yokota2004 and @Williams2011. The EVI is, in essence, the difference
between the expected value of making an optimal decision without
reducing uncertainty and the expected value of making an optimal
decision after uncertainty has been reduced.

Box Ironbark Forest and Woodland management
-------------------------------------------

The Box Ironbark Forest and Woodland (BIFAW) region covers approximately
250,000ha of central Victoria, Australia. The BIFAW are dry plant
communities that occur on low-fertility soils and in a semi-arid to
temperate climate. Much of the pre-European stands of BIFAW were cleared
for agriculture and gold mining. Most of the current extent is highly
fragmented regrowth. These regrowth stands are typically missing key
ecosystem components such as large, hollow-bearing trees and a diverse
understory shrub layer. Tree species found in BIFAW include Grey Box
(*Eucalyptus microcarpa*), Red Box (*E. polyanthemos*), Long Leaf Box
(*E. goniocalyx*), Yellow Box (*E. melliodora*), Red Ironbark (*E.
tricarpa*), Red Stringybark (*E. macrorhyncha*) and Yellow Gum (*E.
leucoxylon*). The BIFAW supports important habitat for three Victorian
listed threatened taxa: the Brush-tailed Phascogale (*Phascogale
tapoatafa*), Powerful Owl (*Ninox strenua*) and Regent Honeyeater
(*Xanthomyza phrygia*) [@Tzaros2005]. The latter is also a federally
listed endangered species. Regent Honeyeaters are threatened because
they rely on large trees for foraging and nesting [@Menkhorst1999].

In 1996 the state government of Victoria commissioned an investigation
into an appropriate system for the protection and management of BIFAW.
As a direct result, over 200,000ha of BIFAW were gazetted as national
park and other protected areas. A key recommendation of the report was
that ‘ecological thinning’ be part of the management strategy of the
BIFAW [@Pigott2009]. The report recommended a program of ecological
thinning be undertaken as part of an ecological management strategy to
assist the development of a forest structure ultimately dominated by
large diameter trees in the new parks and reserves [@ECC2001].
‘Ecological thinning’ is the active reduction of stem density to improve
forest health, while retaining some fallen timber to improve habitat for
plants and animals [@Cunningham2009]. In 2003 the body in charge of
BIFAW park management, Parks Victoria, established an ‘ecological
thinning trial’. The aim of the trial was to investigate whether
‘ecological thinning’ (hereby ‘thinning’) could be used to restore
structural diversity of habitat types and the functioning and
persistence of key communities and species populations [@Pigott2010].

State and transition models of Box Ironbark Forest and Woodland
---------------------------------------------------------------

@Czembor2009 built a suite of simulation models of BIFAW dynamics,
parameterised through expert elicitation using methods adapted from
@Morgan1990. Their BIFAW state and transition models predict the
proportions of a model landscape in four states, including the state
most desired by land-managers, mature, low-density woodland. The models
included three management scenarios, no management/natural disturbance
only (NM), a scenario of limited harvest/firewood removal (HF), and
thinning (ET). In analysing the variation among models which included
three components of uncertainty, @Czembor2011 found that between-expert
uncertainty was the greatest contributor to total model uncertainty,
followed by imperfect individual expert knowledge, then system
stochasticity. In the case presented here we treated the opinions of a
set of experts as a Bayesian prior distribution. Though a proven method
of creating a prior [@Martin2005], experts may not be needed in other
circumstances where other information is available such as the results
of a previous work [@Mccarthy2005], pilot studies [@Morris2013], or a
general model [@Morris2015].

Study objectives
----------------

Management of highly uncertain systems such as the BIFAW can benefit
from investment in learning about the system itself. But in complex
systems with many parameters and multiple state variables changing at
different rates, which aspects of the system should we learn about? To
answer this question we undertook an expected value of information
analysis. We first conducted a sensitivity analyses of the parameters
that constitute the BIFAW models of @Czembor2011. For those parameters
to which the management outcomes were most sensitive, we calculated the
expected partial value of information to determine which parameters have
the greatest value for learning. We also analysed a set of sampling
strategies designed to reduce uncertainty about multiple parameters by
focusing on transitions in and out of particular system states. We also
performed the analyses from the perspective of two different management
agencies and tested the effect of changing the constraints on the
management actions.
