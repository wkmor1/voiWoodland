Introduction
============

Ecosystems are typically managed under uncertainty. Monitoring can reduce uncertainty and facilitate management decisions with greater expected benefits. On the other hand, sometimes it is unclear whether monitoring is necessary [@Mcdonaldmadden2010]. The decision to experiment or monitor at all is only rational if the expected benefit when making a decision with new information, outweighs the cost of learning. Determining the value of information facilitates calculating this benefit [@Raiffa1968].

Value of information (VOI) theory is a set of decision theoretic tools that have previously been applied to decision problems in economics, medicine, engineering and other domains [@Dakins1999; @Yokota2004; @Claxton2008; @Wu2013]. With the VOI toolset, a decision analyst can assess what to monitor, how much to monitor and even whether monitoring is justified at all. Compared with other fields, such as operations research and medicine, ecology and natural resource management have been slower to adopt VOI analyses for decision making, although recently, some examples have appeared in the literature [e.g., @Polasky2001; @Moore2011; @Runge2011; @Runting2013]. Most examples have focused on the application of VOI to models with discrete expressions of uncertainty [e.g., @Moore2012]. Furthermore, ecological decision problem solvers have tended to focus on models of population dynamics [@Runge2011; @Canessa2015; @Johnson2014; @Maxwell2015] and have been less inclined to tackle more complex ecosystem level models.

One reason communities and ecosystems have rarely been the focus of VOI analyses, is that community or ecosystem models do not lend themselves easily to VOI analysis. Ecosystem models, such as state and transition models, are complex and highly parameterized, and often models of communities are continuous rather than discrete [i.e., uncertainty lies in the choices between discrete models as in @Runge2011] making it more difficult to calculate the VOI analytically. Instead, VOI is typically estimated using numerical methods [@Yokota2004].

Calculating the value of information
------------------------------------

A value of information analysis can be used to assess the benefit of reducing epistemic uncertainty before making a decision. A decision analyst cannot know, in advance, what information they will gain if they seek to learn before taking action. With this in mind, the value of information is conceptualized in terms of expected value. An expected value is a value a decision analyst may expect, on average, given the outcome of their decision is uncertain. Expected value is value weighted (multiplied) by probability. For example, for two equally likely events resulting in a value of one and two dollars respectively, the expected value will be one and half dollars.

In this way a decision analyst can calculate the expected value of information. In essence, the expected value _of_ information (EVI) is the difference between the expected value with _new_ information (EVWNI) and the expected value with _original_ information (EVWOI). The expected value of information can come in a number forms depending on the form of new information. Regardless of form, all the variants of VOI analyses assume decisions are being made optimally. That is, the decision analyst considers value to arise from taking actions that maximize the their expected value given the original or new information. To do so, the decision analyst requires a model that can be used to predict the outcomes of possible future decisions. In calculating VOI the analyst will use such a model to predict decision outcomes using the original or new information as their model inputs.

As noted above, value of information can take multiple forms. Here we deal we two forms: the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the partial expected value of perfect information (EVPXI). We refer to these and other related methods collectively, as EVI. Here we will briefly outline the general form of an EVI analysis in terms of EVPI and EVPXI. For a more detailed description of the derivation of EVI and its variants, see the seminal text of @Raiffa1968 and for more recent treatments see @Yokota2004 and @Williams2011.

The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) quantifies the expected performance gain if all uncertainty is resolved prior to taking action [@Raiffa1968]. The EVPI is the upper bound of expected performance improvement and can identify the amount of resources worth investing in to resolve uncertainty [@Runge2011]. While EVPI provides a value for complete reduction of uncertainty, EVPXI, can quantify the performance gain if uncertainty is only partially resolved [@Ades2004]. EVPXI is the value of knowing the exact value of one more (but not all) parameters in a model.

Again, the EVI is the difference between the EVWNI and the EVWOI. When the new information is perfect (i.e., the analysts model will have all uncertainty eliminated) then it follows that:

$$ \mathrm{EVPI} = \mathrm{EVWPI} - \mathrm{EVWOI}, $$

where EVWPI is the expected value _with_ perfect information.

To calculate the expected values EVWPI and EVWOI, like any expected value, the analyst will work out the value they expect to see on average when taking the most optimal, or maximizing actions. More formally:

$$ \mathrm{EVWOI} = Max_{a}[Mean_{s}(Value)] $$

and

$$ \mathrm{EVWPI} = Mean_{s}[Max_{a}(Value)]. $$

Where $a$ indicates the actions available and $s$ indicates initial the uncertainty or the state space (the world of possible scenarios that could lead an action to generate some value). As you can see, both the equations for EVWPI and EVWOI are similar. The key difference is the order of maximization (optimizing) and averaging (taking the mean over the uncertainty). To calculate EVWOI (working from the inside of the equation out) first average over the initial uncertainty and then take the action which maximizes value. Whereas for the EVWPI the opposite is true. First choose the action that maximize value and only then, average this value over the initial uncertainty. Calculating the EVPXI requires a similar yet more complicated approach. For a model with multiple parameters to calculate the EVPXI for the $i^{th}$ parameter(s) of interest is expressed formally as:

$$ \mathrm{EVPXI_i} = \mathrm{EVWPXI_i} - \mathrm{EVWOI}, $$

where,

$$ \mathrm{EVWPXI_i} = Mean_{s_i}\{Max_{a}[Mean_{s_c}(Value)]\}. $$

Here $c$ represents the rest of the parameters in the model with uncertainty, $s$. Partial perfect information requires an additional 'averaging over' step, where value is averaged over the $c^{th}$ not-of-interest parameters, then maximization occurs, before finally averaging over the initial uncertainty of the parameter(s) of interest takes place.

In the following work we apply the above calculations of EVPI and EVPXI to a case study on Box Ironbark Forests and Woodland to ascertain whether and how the addition of new information may improve the outcome of their management. 

Box Ironbark Forest and Woodland management
-------------------------------------------

The Box Ironbark Forest and Woodland (BIFAW) region covers approximately 250,000ha of central Victoria, Australia. The BIFAW are dry plant communities that occur on low-fertility soils and in a semi-arid to temperate climate. Much of the pre-European stands of BIFAW were cleared for agriculture and gold mining. Most of the current extent is highly fragmented regrowth. These regrowth stands are typically missing key ecosystem components such as large, hollow-bearing trees and a diverse understory shrub layer. Tree species found in BIFAW include Grey Box (*Eucalyptus microcarpa*), Red Box (*E. polyanthemos*), Long Leaf Box (*E. goniocalyx*), Yellow Box (*E. melliodora*), Red Ironbark (*E. tricarpa*), Red Stringybark (*E. macrorhyncha*) and Yellow Gum (*E. leucoxylon*). The BIFAW supports important habitat for three Victorian listed threatened taxa: the Brush-tailed Phascogale (*Phascogale tapoatafa*), Powerful Owl (*Ninox strenua*) and Regent Honeyeater (*Xanthomyza phrygia*) [@Tzaros2005]. The latter is also a federally listed endangered species. Regent Honeyeaters are threatened because they rely on large trees for foraging and nesting [@Menkhorst1999].

In 1996 the state government of Victoria commissioned an investigation into an appropriate system for the protection and management of BIFAW. As a direct result, over 200,000 ha of BIFAW were gazetted as national park and other protected areas. A key recommendation of the report was that 'ecological thinning' be part of the management strategy of the BIFAW [@Pigott2009]. The report recommended a program of ecological thinning be undertaken as part of an ecological management strategy to assist the development of a forest structure ultimately dominated by large diameter trees in the new parks and reserves [@ECC2001]. 'Ecological thinning' is the active reduction of stem density to improve forest health, while retaining some fallen timber to improve habitat for plants and animals [@Cunningham2009]. In 2003 the body in charge of BIFAW park management, Parks Victoria, established an 'ecological thinning trial'. The aim of the trial was to investigate whether 'ecological thinning' (hereby 'thinning') could be used to restore structural diversity of habitat types and the functioning and persistence of key communities and species populations [@Pigott2010].

State and transition models of Box Ironbark Forest and Woodland
---------------------------------------------------------------

@Czembor2009 built a suite of simulation models of BIFAW dynamics, parameterized through expert elicitation using methods adapted from @Morgan1990. Their BIFAW state and transition models predict the proportions of a model landscape in four states, including the states most desired by land-managers, low-density mature woodland and high-density mature woodland. The models included three management scenarios, no management/natural disturbance only (NM), a scenario of limited harvest/firewood removal (HF), and thinning (ET). In analyzing the variation among models which included three components of uncertainty, @Czembor2011 found that between-expert uncertainty was the greatest contributor to total model uncertainty, followed by imperfect individual expert knowledge, then system stochasticity. In the case presented here we treated the opinions of a set of experts as the initial state of uncertainty. 

Study objectives
----------------

Management of uncertain systems such as the BIFAW can benefit from investment in learning about the system itself. But in complex systems with many parameters and multiple state variables changing at different rates, which aspects of the system should we learn about? To answer this question we undertook an EVI analysis using the models of @Czembor2011. To find the upper bound on the value of information and see if there was any real value in new information we calculated EVPI. We then calculated the EVPXI for all transition probabilities to determine which parameters have the greatest value for learning. We also analysed a set of sampling strategies that reduce uncertainty about multiple parameters at once by calculating EVPXI for two parameters of transitions out of each system state and two parameters of transitions for each management strategy. Finally we tested the effect of varying a constraint on action to see what happened to the EVI when there were more or less options available to a manager.
