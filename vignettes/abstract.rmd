Abstract
========

Value of information (VOI) analyses reveal the expected benefit of reducing uncertainty. Most ecological VOI analyses focus on population ecology and discrete expressions of uncertainty, rarely addressing complex community models or models with continuous uncertainty. We performed VOI analyses for a complex state and transition model of Box-Ironbark Forest and Woodland management with continuous parameter uncertainty. With three management alternatives (limited harvest/firewood removal, ecological thinning and no management), managing the system optimally (for 150 years) with the original information, would on average, increase the amount of forest in a desirable state from 19 to 35%. Resolving all uncertainty would, on average, increase the final percentage to 42%. In other words, after resolving all uncertainty, we would expect to more than double the performance from management. However, only resolving the uncertainty for a single parameter was worth almost two-thirds the value of resolving all uncertainty. We found the VOI to be dependent on the number of management options. When the number of management options increased, the value of perfect information increased linearly. However the partial value of perfect information increased at different rates for different model parameters. Our analyses show it is more cost-effective to monitor low-density regrowth forest than other states, and more cost-effective to experiment with the 'no management' alternative than the other management alternatives. Importantly, the most cost-effective strategies did not include either the most desired forest states, nor the least understood management strategy, ecological thinning. This implies that managers cannot just rely on intuition to tell them where the most value of information will lie, as critical uncertainties in a complex system are sometimes cryptic.
