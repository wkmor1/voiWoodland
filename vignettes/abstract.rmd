Value of information (VOI) analyses reveal the expected benefit of reducing uncertainty. Most ecological VOI analyses focus on population ecology and discrete expressions of uncertainty, rarely addressing complex community models or models with continuous uncertainty. We performed VOI analyses for a complex state and transition model of Box-Ironbark Forest and Woodland management. In contrast to previous work, this study focuses on a community ecology-based decision, a subfield of applied ecology where VOI has not been implemented before. We also extend the field by demonstrating VOI for a decision model with continuous uncertainty. We overcome the difficulties of calculating VOI for complex models with continuous uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning. Resolving all uncertainty in a system model of Box-Ironbark management would improve the expected outcome. With three management alternatives (limited harvest/firewood removal, ecological thinning and no management), managing the system without information, would on average, increase the amount of forest in a desirable state from 16 to 24% (after 150 years). Resolving all uncertainty would, on average, increase the final percentage to 33%. However, only resolving the uncertainty for a single parameter (a probability of transition from low-density regrowth to high-density regrowth) was worth almost one-third the value of resolving all uncertainty (equal to an additional 7500 hectares of desirable-state forest). We found the VOI to be dependent on the number of management options. When the number of management options increased, the value of perfect information increased linearly. However the value of partial perfect information increased at different rates for different model parameters. Our analyses show it is more cost-effective to monitor low-density regrowth forest than other states, and more cost-effective to experiment with the limited harvest/firewood removal alternative than the other management alternatives. Importantly, the most cost-effective strategies did not include either the most desired forest state, nor the least understood management strategy, ecological thinning. This implies that managers cannot just rely on intuition to tell them where the most value of information will lie, as critical uncertainties in a complex system could be cryptic.
